/* 49. Group Anagrams
 *
 * Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
 * typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
 * Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= strs.length <= 104
 * 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
